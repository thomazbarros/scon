An implementation of  JDBC for accessing SPARQL endpoints.

The goal of this project is to transparently allow JDBC code run against a SPARQL endpoint. Ultimately, any operations that make sense in SPARQL and RDF should be possible through this API. This will allow anyone familiar with JDBC to easily interface with SPARQL, or to use JDBC tools to communicate with a SPARQL endpoint.

See the [Introduction](Introduction.md) for more, including sample code using this library.
